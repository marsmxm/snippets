This repository contains all the code examples from the book "The Little
MLer." The Little MLer book has two goals. The first and primary goal is to
teach you to think recursively about types and programs. The second goal is to
expose you to two important topics concerning large programs: dealing with
exceptional situations and composing program components.

The code examples were copied (and completed where necessary) from
"The Little MLer" by Peteris Krumins (peter@catonmat.net).

[01]-Chapter-1-Building-Blocks------------------------------------------------

See 01-building-blocks.ml file for code examples.

Chapter 1 introduces data types. For example, the type of integer 5 is int and
the type of real number 5.32 is real. You can also define your own data types.
For example,

    datatype seasoning =
            Salt
        |   Pepper;

introduces a new data type 'seasoning'. Salt and Pepper now both are of type
seasoning.

Data types can also be recursive, for example,

    datatype num =
            Zero
        |   One_more_than of num;

creates a type num, that is either Zero, or One_more_than of itself. For
example, One_more_than(Zero) is a num. So is One_more_than(One_more_than(Zero)).

Next, parametrized types are introduced. Here is an example,

    datatype 'a open_faced_sandwich =
            Bread of 'a
        |   Slice of 'a open_faced_sandwich;

The elements of this datatype are Bread(0), Bread(true), Slice(Bread(0)). In
these examples, 'a get associated with types int, bool and open_faced_sandwich.

Finally the chapter presents the first moral:

.----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|                                                                            |
| The first moral:                                                           |
|                                                                            |
| Use datatype to describe types. When a type contains lots of values, the   |
| datatype definition refers to itself. Use 'a with datatype to define       |
| shapes.                                                                    |
|                                                                            |
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'


[02]-Chapter-2-Matchmaker-----------------------------------------------------

See 02-matchmaker.ml file for code examples.

Chapter 2 introduces functions, pattern matching on function arguments and
recursion. It takes you very carefully through several examples so you
understood the topic precisely.

For example, given this datatype,

    datatype 'a shish =
            Bottom of 'a
        |   Onion of 'a shish
        |   Lamb of 'a shish
        |   Tomato of 'a shish;

then the following function determines the type of Bottom,

    fun what_bottom(Bottom(x))
        = x
     |  what_bottom(Onion(x))
        = what_bottom(x)
     |  what_bottom(Lamb(x))
        = what_bottom(x)
     |  what_bottom(Tomato(x))
        = what_bottom(x);

The data type of this function is 'a shish -> 'a, that is, it takes a
parametrizable type 'a shish and returns the parametrization 'a.

Here is an example of applying this function.

    what_bottom(Onion(Lamb(Tomato(Bottom(55)))));

It produces value 55 because it matches the Onion(x) rule, where x is
Lamb(Tomato(Bottom(55))), and recurses with the argument x on itself. Next
it matches Lamb(x), with x being Tomato(Bottom(55)) and recurses. Then it
matches Tomato(Bottom(x)), setting x to Bottom(55) and recurses. Finally the
first rule Bottom(x) matches, with x being 55. This rule is the result of the
function, therefore the result is 55.

The chapter ends with the second moral:

.----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|                                                                            |
| The second moral:                                                          |
|                                                                            |
| The number and order of the patterns in the definition of a function shold |
| match that of the definition of the consumed datatype.                     |
|                                                                            |
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'

[03]-Chapter-3-Cons-Is-Still-Magnificent--------------------------------------

See 03-cons-magnificent.ml file for code examples.

Chapter 3 continues the adventure of manipulating datatypes. The examples in
this chapter show how to remove a level of datatype, how to add a level of
datatype and how to modify a level. The mindset you develop with these
examples is the same as in Lisp, where you manipulate lists by taking car and
cdr, dropping car, replacing car and consing the result together. That's why
the title involves the word "cons".

The first example in this chapter shows how to remove a level of nested type
and how to add a level of datatype (don't know how to express myself correctly
on what the example does.)

Here is an example, suppose you have this datatype,

    datatype pizza =
            Crust
        |   Cheese of pizza
        |   Onion of pizza
        |   Anchovy of pizza
        |   Sausage of pizza;

And you have constructed an item of this type,

    Anchovy(
      Onion(
        Anchovy(
          Anchovy(
            Cheese(
              Crust)))));

And you wish to remove all occurances of Anchovy from the type. Then the
following function does it,

    fun remove_anchovy(Crust)
        = Crust
     |  remove_anchovy(Cheese(x))
        = Cheese(remove_anchovy(x))
     |  remove_anchovy(Onion(x))
        = Onion(remove_anchovy(x))
     |  remove_anchovy(Anchovy(x))
        = remove_anchovy(x)
     |  remove_anchovy(Sausage(x))
        = Sausage(remove_anchovy(x));

The base case here is Crust, and then it uses pattern matching on types
Cheese(x), Onion(x), Anchovy(x), Sausage(x). If the type is Anchovy(x), then
the Anchovy is removed by recusing on matched pattern x and dropping Anchovy.

Similarly, functions to add a layer and replace a layer are written.

At the end of the chapter, as usual, the third moral is presented.

.----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|                                                                            |
| The third moral:                                                           |
|                                                                            |
| Functions that produce values of a datatype must use the associated        |
| constructors to build data of that type.                                   |
|                                                                            |
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'


[04]-Chapter-4-Look-to-the-Stars----------------------------------------------

See 04-stars.ml file for code examples.

Chapter 4 introduces stars and functions on stars. Stars combine datatypes.
For example, consider these two datatypes,

    datatype meza = 
            Shrimp
        |   Calamari
        |   Escargots
        |   Hummus;

    datatype main =
            Steak
        |   Ravioli
        |   Chicken
        |   Eggplant;

If we write that something is of type (meza*main), then we mean all items
from the set of all possible combinations of meza and main:

    (Shrimp,Steak)
    (Shrimp,Ravioli)
    (Shrimp,Chicken)
    (Shrimp,Eggplant)
    (Calamari,Steak)
    (Calamari,Ravioli)
    (Calamari,Chicken)
    (Calamari,Eggplant)
    (Escargots,Steak)
    (Escargots,Ravioli)
    (Escargots,Chicken)
    (Escargots,Eggplant)
    (Hummus,Steak)
    (Hummus,Ravioli)
    (Hummus,Chicken)
    (Hummus,Eggplant)

We can then introduce functions that consume (and produce) stars. For example,

    fun has_steak(a:meza,Steak,d:dessert):bool
        = true
     |  has_steak(a:meza,ns,d:dessert):bool
        = false;

The has_steak function takes a (meza*main*dessert) and produces a bool,
depending on main. If main is Steak, then it's true, otherwise it's false.

The chapter also shows how to do pattern matching more effectively and how to
force types for function arguments (like in the example above).

The fourth moral follows:

.----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|                                                                            |
| The fourth moral:                                                          |
|                                                                            |
| Some functions consume values of star type; some produce values of star    |
| type.                                                                      |
|                                                                            |
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'


[05]-Chapter-5-Couples-Are-Magnificent-Too------------------------------------

See 05-couples.ml file for code examples.

Chapter 5 shows how to create data types with stars. Here is an example,

    datatype 'a pizza =
            Bottom
        |   Topping of ('a * ('a pizza));

The members of this 'a pizza are all possible parametrizations of 'a pizza.
For example, int pizza, bool pizza, dessert pizza, etc. More concrete
example is Topping(true, Topping(true, Bottom)), which is of type bool pizza.

Then the chapter shows how to work on datatypes like these, and how to do
efficient pattern matching, and how to shorten the written functions by
thinking how the patterns matched.

For example, this long function,

    fun rem_fish(x, Bottom)
        = Bottom
     |  rem_fish(Anchovy, Topping(Anchovy, p))
        = rem_fish(Anchovy, p)
     |  rem_fish(Anchovy, Topping(t, p))
        = Topping(t, rem_fish(Anchovy, p))
     |  rem_fish(Lox, Topping(Lox, p))
        = rem_fish(Lox, p)
     |  rem_fish(Lox, Topping(t, p))
        = Topping(t, rem_fish(Lox, p))
     |  rem_fish(Tuna, Topping(Tuna, p))
        = rem_fish(Tuna, p)
     |  rem_fish(Tuna, Topping(t, p))
        = Topping(t, rem_fish(Tuna,p));

Can be rewritten as:

    fun rem_fish2(x, Bottom)
        = Bottom
     |  rem_fish2(x, Topping(t, p))
        = if eq_fish(x, t)
            then rem_fish2(x, p)
            else Topping(t,rem_fish2(x,p));

With the help of helper function eq_fish.

The fifth moral follows:

.----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|                                                                            |
| The fifth moral:                                                           |
|                                                                            |
| Write the first draft of a function following all the morals. When it is   |
| correct and no sooner, simplify.                                           |
|                                                                            |
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'


[06]-Chapter-6-Oh-My-Its-Full-of-Stars----------------------------------------

See 06-full-of-stars.ml file for code examples.

Chapter 6 shows how to build fruit trees and how to define mutually recursive
datatypes and functions.

For example, here is a mutually recursive datatype,

    datatype 
        'a slist =
                Empty
            |   Scons of (('a sexp)*('a slist))
    and
        'a sexp =
                An_atom of 'a
            |   A_slist of ('a slist);

An example member of it is,

    Scons(An_atom(5),
      Scons(An_atom(13),
        Scons(An_atom(1), Empty)));

And it has the datatype of 'int slist' because the shape 'a is 'int'.

The sixth moral is stated:

.----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|                                                                            |
| The sixth moral:                                                           |
|                                                                            |
| As datatype definitions get more complicated, so do the functions over     |
| them.                                                                      |
|                                                                            |
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'


[07]-Chapter-7-Functions-Are-People-Too---------------------------------------

See 07-functions-are-people.ml file for code examples.

Chapter 7 focuses on functions, how they can be consumed by other functions as
values, and how they can be returned from functions as values. It also shows
how datatype constructors are also functions.

Here is an example, given this datatype,

    datatype bool_or_int =
        Hot  of bool
     |  Cold of int;

Guess what is Hot? It's a function bool -> bool_or_int!

Here is a problem that makes your hat not fit on your head anymore.
What is this:

    datatype chain =
        Link of (int * (int -> chain));

It's a self-referential datatype. Here is a function that is a member of this
datatype:

    fun ints(n)
        = Link(n+1, ints);

Now ints(0) is Link(1, ints), ints(1) is Link(2, ints), ... .

The chapter continues exploring this self-referential datatype and ends with
currying and the seventh moral.

.----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|                                                                            |
| The seventh moral:                                                         |
|                                                                            |
| Some functions consume values of arrow type; some produce values of arrow  |
| type.                                                                      |
|                                                                            |
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'


[08]-Chapter-8-Bows-and-Arrows------------------------------------------------

See 08-bows-and-arrows.ml file for code examples.

Chapter 8 is all about how to do currying. 

For example, this function,

    fun in_range_c(small,large)(x)
        = x>small andalso x<large;

Produces a function that can be called in two stages, first, calling it as
in_range_c(10,20) returns a function that would check if the next argument is
between 10 and 20. Here is an example,

    fun in_range_c_10_20 =
        in_range_c(10,20);

    in_range_c_10_20(15);   (* true *)

From all this currying the eight moral emerges:

.----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|                                                                            |
| The eighth moral:                                                          |
|                                                                            |
| Replace stars by arrows to reduce the number of values consumed and to in- |
| crease the generality of the function defined.                             |
|                                                                            |
'----------------------------------------------------------------------------'


[09]-Chapter-9-Oh-No----------------------------------------------------------

See 09-oh-no.ml file for code examples.

Chapter 9 teaches exceptions and how to handle them. Here is an example,
suppose you have a list of bacons and indexes,

    datatype 'a list =
        Empty
     |  Cons of 'a * 'a list;

    datatype box =
        Bacon
     |  Ix of int;

And you want to find the position where bacon appears. So you write a fun-
ction where_is,

    fun where_is(Empty)
        = 0
     |  where_is(Cons(a_box, rest))
        = if a_box=Bacon
            then 1
            else 1 + where_is(rest);

But it doesn't quite work, because if there is no bacon in the list, it
returns the length of the list. We can solve that by introducing an exception
and raising it when no bacon was found,

    exception No_bacon of int;

    fun where_is(Empty)
        = raise No_bacon(0)
     |  where_is(Cons(a_box, rest))
        = if is_bacon(a_box)
            then 1
            else 1 + where_is(rest);

When where_is gets called, we have to handle this exception, so we write

    (where_is(
      Cons(Ix(5),
        Cons(Ix(13),
          Cons(Ix(8),
            Empty))))
      handle
        No_bacon(an_int)
        => an_int);

Which will return 0 when no bacon was found.

The other half of the chapter is spent playing Find the Bacon game, at the
end the ninth moral is stated:

.----------------------------------------------------------------------------.

[10]-Chapter-10-Building-On-Blocks--------------------------------------------

See 10-building-on-blocks.ml file for code examples.

Chapter 10 is the most complicated chapter in the book, it talks about
signatures, functors and structures.

If you're coming from OO world, then think of signatures as interfaces,
functors as implementations and structures as the result of constructing a
functor.

The chapter introduces these concepts via Peano numbers. Suppose you want to
do arithmetic using several number systems. They all share common properties,
such as succ, for succeeding number, pred for preceding number and is_zero
that tests if the number is zero.

Given these properties, you may define a signature for a number system,

    signature N =
        sig
            type number
            exception Too_small
            val succ    : number -> number
            val pred    : number -> number
            val is_zero : number -> bool
        end;

The signature says that for a number system to be of good use it has to
implement functions succ, pred, is_zero that act on type number and may throw
an exception Too_small.

Now here is an implementation (functor) of a number system using lists,

    functor NumberAsNum()
        :>
        N
        =
        struct
            datatype num =
                Zero
             |  One_more_than of num
            type number = num
            exception Too_small
            fun succ(n) =
                One_more_than(n)
            fun pred(Zero)
                = raise Too_small
             |  pred(One_more_than(n))
                = n
            fun is_zero(Zero)
                = true
             |  is_zero(foo)
                = false;
        end;

And here is an implementation of a number system using integers:

    functor NumberAsInt()
        :>
        N
        =
        struct
            type number = int
            exception Too_small
            fun succ(n) = n + 1
            fun pred(n)
                = if n=0
                    then raise Too_small
                    else n-1
            fun is_zero(n)
                = n=0
        end;

Now we can use functors to construct structures. Here is a structure that
uses ints as numbers,

    structure IntStruct = NumberAsInt();

And here is one that uses lists as numbers,

    structure NumStruct = NumberAsNum();

But you can't quite use them because the implementation uses number datatype
internally and you don't have access to this datatype.

The book continues to solving this problem and shows two ways how to solve
this type mismatch problem. It ends with the last, tenth moral:

| The tenth moral:                                                           |
|                                                                            |
| Real programs consist of many components. Specify the dependencies among   |
| these components using signatures and functors.                            |

That's it. I hope you find these examples useful when reading "The Little
MLer" yourself! Go get it at http://bit.ly/8rlLXG, if you haven't already!
